# KYC-FaceVerification
Face verification using deep learning with an ensemble of Facenet512 and ArcFace models. Supports image comparison via local files or URLs. Efficient, accurate, and easily integrable into KYC, authentication, and security systems. 

# 🔍 Face Verification Using Deep Learning (Facenet512 + ArcFace Ensemble)

This project is a complete pipeline for **face verification** using deep learning models. It enables users to verify whether two face images belong to the same person — supporting **local files and online URLs**. The implementation includes an **ensemble of two state-of-the-art models**: **Facenet512** and **ArcFace**, combined for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

## 🧠 Models Used

1. **Facenet512**
   * **Framework**: InsightFace (PyTorch)
   * **Advantages**:
     * Lightweight yet powerful
     * Produces compact and discriminative 512D embeddings
     * Works well with small datasets
   * **Use Case**: Real-time applications, facial clustering, and verification
   * **Disadvantages**:
     * Sensitive to extreme pose variations or occlusions

2. **ArcFace (ResNet100-based)**
   * **Framework**: InsightFace (PyTorch)
   * **Advantages**:
     * Excellent performance on benchmarks like LFW, CFP-FP
     * Uses Additive Angular Margin Loss to maximize inter-class distance
     * Highly discriminative embeddings
   * **Disadvantages**:
     * Heavier than Facenet512 in terms of model size
     * Slower inference on lower-end hardware

## ✅ **Ensemble Strategy**
* The **cosine similarity scores** from both models are averaged
* Improves robustness, compensates for individual model weaknesses
* Efficient ensemble without significant computational overhead

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### Backend
* **Python 3.10+**
* **Flask** for API
* **InsightFace** for face recognition models
* **OpenCV / PIL** for image preprocessing
* **Requests / urllib** for downloading image URLs
* **NumPy** for similarity score computation

### Frontend (Optional or extendable)
* Basic API calls for face verification
* Can be integrated with any web/mobile frontend

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **User Input**:
   * Upload or pass a local/online image URL (reference image)
   * Upload a second image for comparison (query image)
2. **Preprocessing**:
   * Face detection and alignment (handled by InsightFace)
   * Convert to suitable tensor format
3. **Embedding Generation**:
   * Extract 512D face embeddings using **Facenet512** and **ArcFace**
4. **Similarity Scoring**:
   * Calculate **cosine similarity** between the reference and query embeddings
   * Combine both scores using a simple average
5. **Thresholding**:
   * If average score > `0.5`, consider **same person**
   * Else, mark as **different**
6. **Result**:
   * Returns success/failure message with similarity score

## 💾 Features

* ✅ **URL and local image support**
* ✅ **Temp image caching**
* ✅ **Reference embedding caching** for faster verification
* ✅ **Multi-model ensemble**
* ✅ **Simple REST API structure**
* ✅ **Open for integration with web/mobile apps**
* ✅ **Extensible for video/KYC/fraud detection**
